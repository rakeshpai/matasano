So, [CG recommended](https://twitter.com/chaitanya_gupta/status/1020616569976745984) that I take a stab at the [Matasano Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/). This repo is my (incomplete) attempt.

Clone the repo, and then
```
npm install
npm start
```

Uses the node.js Buffer module extensively. Uses Jest as a test runner. The rest is vanilla JS.
